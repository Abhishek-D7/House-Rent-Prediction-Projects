The primary focus was on utilizing Python along with prominent libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Sci-kit Learn. The project encompassed tasks related to data preprocessing, model implementation, and thorough visualization of the results.

Core Python formed the foundation for the entire implementation, while Numpy facilitated efficient numerical operations. Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library, played a crucial role in handling and processing the dataset. The visual representation of data and model performance was accomplished using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

The implementation of a linear regression model from scratch using core Python and Numpy. Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning, and developing it from scratch provides a deep understanding of its inner workings. The custom implementation involved defining the necessary mathematical functions, including the cost function and gradient descent algorithm.

A key highlight of the project was the comparison between the custom linear regression model and the one provided by Sci-kit Learn. While Sci-kit Learn is a widely-used and highly optimized library for machine learning, it was essential to validate the custom model against it to assess its effectiveness. The mean squared error (MSE) was employed as the evaluation metric.
